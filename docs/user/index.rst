==================

This part will focus on the usage of the ACN simulator. To use the simulator one must specify a scheduling algorithm and
a test case the scheduling algorithm will run over. There are already some pre-written scheduling algorithms to use in the simulation
and these will also serve as good examples and guidelines when writing scheduling algorithms.
